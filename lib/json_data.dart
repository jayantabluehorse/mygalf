              "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), excessive heat exposure caused 8,015 deaths in the United States from 1979-2003. For many, summer offers the best opportunity to get your workout in outdoors but harsh heat can pose a real threat to your health and wellbeing. Planning ahead will keep your outdoor workouts safe and fun.\n\nHeat-related illnesses, including heat exhaustion and heat stroke, occur when your body can’t cool itself properly. In extreme cases, overheating can hurt the brain and other vital organs. Sweat normally keeps us cool, but in some cases, sweat just can’t keep up with your body.\n\nLearn all about exercising outside with these helpful tips!\n\nPlan for the Heat\nSchedule your outdoor exercise around the coolest part of the day: early in the morning or after nightfall.Take advantage of shaded paths. Wear light-colored, breathable clothing. Choose cotton or moisture-wicking fabrics that allow air to circulate without chafing. Wear a hat, sunglasses, and sports-suitable sunscreen.\n\nStay Hydrated\nWe can’t say this enough: drink more water! In high heat and humid conditions, it’s easy to underestimate how much water you need to drink. The CDC directs you to drink 16-32 oz. of water each hour during heavy exercise in a hot environment. If you have a hard time keeping up with that amount, try using flavored water—add a wedge of lime to your water bottle or try a sports drink. If you aren’t on a salt-restricted diet, you can allow yourself a few more salty snacks (like pretzels and chips and salsa) to replenish the sodium lost through sweat.\n\nDress Appropriately\nExercising outside means you are waving goodbye to the comforts of your indoor gym. For many, that’s the allure—but dressing properly is important. If you plan to break a sweat in a wooded area, put a light jacket over your favorite tank top to make sure you are fully clothed. If you’re working out in a park or on a pathway with little to no shade, make sure to wear a hat and load up on the SPF.\n\nBe Cautious of Overheating\nExercising raises your body temperature, and when the air is hotter than your body, heat can’t dissipate into the air. To make the situation worse, heat gets trapped in dark-colored asphalt and the sun reflects off water, sand and glass, bombarding you with heat from every direction. This environment is ripe for heat-related illness, but with some good sense, you can still enjoy your time outside, without having to pay for it later.\n\nPace Yourself\nFocus on the experience when exercising outdoors and don’t expect to set personal records. To avoid over-working yourself, wear your heart rate monitor and know your target heart rate for your age and fitness level. The American Council on Exercise even provides a heart rate calculator!\n\nFind an Exercise Buddy or Group\nWorking out is always way more fun when you do it with friends. It’s also safer—and when you’re exercising outside, safety is top of mind. There are lots of local exercise groups on Facebook and some Anytime Fitness clubs offer free outdoor workouts in the month of May to kick off a summer of fitness fun. Check with your local Anytime Fitness to see where you can find May Free Workouts!",

              "Instead of a spring clean we are dedicating the long weekend to a spring check-in. The third month of the year is shortly coming to a close and if you’re like us, you too are wondering how that happened so fast!\n\nThis is a great time to check-in with your goals and reflect on the progress you’ve made thus far. Here are 3 steps we take to make sure we're heading on the right track:\n\n1. MEASURE AND EVALUATE\n\n Evaluate the progress you've made so far against your goals, taking into consideration all external variables. This exercise will allow you to be realistic with yourself and highlight any changes that you may need to make.\n\nDon't stress if you aren't seeing as many results as you had hoped for so far. This first three-month check-in allows for a second kick-start to weed out any bad habits and get you back in the game. \n\n2. REVISE\n\nAfter evaluating your progress, it might be time to make some small tweaks to your goals. These could be based on different factors including changes in your lifestyle/schedule, different training type, accessibility to equipment or progress already made. \n\nUpdate your goals based on what you think will remain challenging but also realistic, so that it will work in with your current lifestyle. Tip! Bringing in some regression exercises or smaller benchmarks to hit are great ways to getting you that step closer to achieving your overall goal.\n\nWith that said, you might find that you are actually making good progress with what you are already doing. If that’s the case then even better, keep doing what you’re doing and continue to work hard!\n\n3. TRACK YOURSELF WEEKLY\n\nNow that your goals are fresh in your mind, try implementing an added tool of motivation that holds yourself accountable on a weekly basis.   \n\nMethods for this will largely depend on your goals, so find something that works for you. Things such as logging times or distance, tracking resistance or reps and body measurements or images are great ways to ensure that you are making progress. Don't get too hung up on the weekly results, as these are likely to fluctuate, but rather use this as an extra tool if you feel motivation slipping. \n\n Checking in with your goals is a great way to keep you focused and on track. While setting high goals is great, they can sometimes become overwhelming or begin to seem unattainable. This is often when motivation lacks. It helps to set smaller benchmarks along the way to make these larger goals more digestible.\n\n So take some time to reflect and re-evaluate and then get back to #AlwaysTraining!\n\nIf you have any other tips or tricks to achieving your goals, let us know. We would love to hear from you!",

              "Roshitha Girish has been associated with Yoga for close to a decade. Having worked at various companies & finally at Bain Capital for close to 10 years, she quit the Corporate World as destiny had other plans for her. After a long corporate stint in Mumbai, Roshitha did a formal Yoga course at Kavalayadhyam and Pranayama course from Athmaboth Yoga Centre. She is now a Yoga Instructor and a passionate painter.\n\nMy Mat is my canvas and Yoga my art\n\nPeople associate Yoga with just the asana practice and the physical aspect it has on one’s body externally. There is no doubt that yoga is a fantastic form of physical exercise to keep one fitter and younger looking, but sadly people miss out on the finer aspects of yoga. Yoga does not limit itself to only the physical benefits but also immensely helps the mind and soul. Hatha Yoga is the traditional practice of yoga when the sadak or practitioner holds the poses for a long duration. Its slow paced yoga but the benefits you reap for your internal body are phenomenal. The longer you hold the more your muscles are activated and in-return it stimulates the internal organs helping them function better. I would like to list down a few important aspects of yoga and pranayama practice that a lot of people may not be aware of.\n\nAshtanga Yoga – Eight Limbs of Yoga\n\nFirst Limb -Yama: External Restraints: Helps to guide the practitioner while living in the outside world. There are 5 Yamas-\n\nAhimsa – Non Harming: Causing no harm to others or to yourself, neither by thoughts, words or actions.\nSatya - Truthfulness: This involves honesty, forgiveness and being non- judgemental.\nAsteya – Non Stealing: This involves not taking resources from others and requires developing a sensitive self-sufficiency.\nBhramacharya – Self Recontrol: This involves how you manage your emotions and how you direct your energy.\nAparigraha –Non Possessiveness: This involves letting go of greed and seeking only what is needed.\nSecond Limb - Niyama: internal Disciplines: Helps the practitioner to clear his internal world, to understand his personality better.\n\nSaucha – Purity: Means keeping your thoughts, speech and body pure.\nSantosha- Contentment: Means being happy and grateful as you are without feeling the need or desire to change things from how they are in the present moment.\nTapas – Purification: Means Austerity or discipline.\nSwadyaya  - Self Study: To analyse yourself. This includes reading, reflection and meditation.\nIswara Pranidhana: Surrender to God: This means being devoted to your divinity rather than your personal desires.\nThird Limb - Asana – Postures: Asanas are postures for health and meditation.\n\nFourth Limb - Pranayama – Regulation of vital force/ breath control: Helps in health and vitality of the body, increases focus, balances emotions and promotes a feeling of contentedness.\n\nFifth Limb - Pratyahara – Sensory Withdrawal: It’s a state of internal focus. It’s a state achieved by quietening the outside stimulation and concentrating of the mind.\n\nSixth Limb - Dharana – Meditative concentration: Is a state of one point in concentration. In the state of Dharana the mind has a single point of concentration and avoids other thoughts.\n\nSeventh Limb - Dhyana – Deep meditation: In Dhyana, the consciousness of the act of meditation dissolves and there is only the consciousness of being and the pure concentration on the object of focus.\n\nEigth Limb - Samadi – Merging: Final stage of deep meditation, where the ego mind too dissolves and the meditator totally merges with the object of concentration. This is the most satisfying stage. Becoming equal to the creator Adi.\n\nTo summarise the eight limbs of yoga, it’s a system for refining and developing the body and mind as a whole system, ultimately to achieve peace, bliss and union.\n\nSome Key points:\n\nYoga isn’t about executing the poses perfectly or having the best balance. Yoga is connecting with yourself. Yoga is learning to breathe peacefully again, taking a moment from your stressful upbeat life and remembering you have a soul that needs tending too. \n\nYoga is a powerful vehicle for change as you build strength you start to believe in your own potential. \n\nYoga frees you from the drama, the tragedy, the saga your mind creates and allows to experience your true self. \n\n\n\nPRANAYAMA:\n\nPranayam according to Patanjali is Tasmin Sati svasa-prasvasa- yor-gati vicchedha pranayama.This means once a person has mastered the practice of asana, the pause between inhaling and exhaling that you experience is pranayama.\n\nPranayam means expanding the life force. The Pran Shakti or life force enters the body through breath. The oxygen we breathe is cosmic energy that gives life. Pranayama helps in the flow of pranic energy in the nadia or nerves. Helps to control the ‘Chitt’ or Mind. Helps to bring in awareness. Creates super consciousness. Regular practice for Pranayama leads to Ekagrata or concentration. Trains the brain to live in the present, not in the past or future. Helps you to take decisions. The three important aspects of Pranayama – Spiritual: Expands life, Physiological: controlling the involuntary system and Physical: controls the physical aspects of the body.\n\nThere are 72864 nerves or nadis in our body.The three most important nadis are ‘Ida nadi’, starting from the tip of the left nostril going down all the way upto the base of the spine. The ‘Pingla nadi’ starting from the right nostril going down all the way to the base of the spine and the ‘Sushmana Nadi’ the one the is between the Ida and Pingla nadis, starts from the brain and goes down to the base of the spine. There are 10 energy points or chakras in our spine. They are, Agi Chakra located at the perineum, Mooladhara Chakra located at the tail bone just above the anal opening, Swadhistana Chakra found just above the genital organs, Manipura chakra found at the base of your naval, Anahita Chakra found near the heart, Manas Chakra found near the right armpit, Vishudha Chakra found near the vocal cords, Agya Chakra forund between the eyebrows, Soam Chakra found above the left eyebrow and the Sahisrara Chakra found near the crown of the head.\n\nI would like to stress on few aspects one must consciously follow while practicing pranayama. One can sit in any meditative asana – Sukhasan, Swastikasan, Samasan or Padmasan. The most ideal meditative asana for practicing Pranayam is Padmasan as it creates a balance in the body. Your spine should be absolutely straight so that the chakras are aligned in one straight line. Every time you practice pranayama one must focus on the chakras or imaginary lotus flowers. \n\nThere are three phases in pranayama. Purak, i.e inhailing, Rechak i.e exhailing and Khumbhak i.e holding on to your breadth. During Khumbhak phase one can hold the breadth inside or outside the body but in Hatha yoga tradition one hold the breadth inside (Internal retention of breadth).\n\nWhile holding on to the breadth the pressure inside the chest and abdominal cavity increases, to cope with that we use Bandhas. There are three bandhas, the Mula Bhandha i.e contraction of the anal muscles and lifting it up slightly. Jalandhara Bandha – Bending the neck forward and pressing the chin on the upper part of the sternum. Uddiyana Bandh – the chest is expanded completely and the diaphragm gets tense pulling the abdomenmal wall inwards. Purak to Rechak should be 1:2 ratio and Khumbak should be double or four times Purak. \n\n\n\nDifferent types of Pranayama as er HathaPratipika- Suryabedhan, Ujjayi, Sitkari, Sitali, Bhastrika, Bhramari, Murccha, Plavini. Please note Kapalbhati belongs to the group of Yogic practice called Shodan Kriyas. Anulom Vilom practice falls under Nadi shodan Kriya. \n\nKapalbhati and Anulom Vilonm can be practiced one after the other followed by pranayama. One needn’t practice all eight pranayama in one day. Practicing Kapalbhati and Aunulom Vilom on daily bases helps one to maintain overall health in the long run.\n\nPranayama must be practiced the right way otherwise it can wreck your entire nervous system.",

              "Warm Water: Nectar for Your Health\n\nAs I pose with this Coffee mug I'd love to copy paste a nice Coffee Quote but I'm drinking hot water, nothing fancy. Drinking hot water can provide your body with the water it needs to replenish fluids. It's good to drink hot water as a holistic health remedy, first thing in the morning or right before bed for optimal health benefit\n\nHealth Benefits of Drinking Warm Water:\n1. Relieves nasal congestion.\n2. Aids digestion.\n3. Calms central nervous system.\n4. Helps relieve constipation.\n5. Keeps you hydrated.\n6. Aids in weight loss & bloating.\n7. Improves circulation.\n8. Can decrease stress levels\nSince drinking hot water helps improve central nervous system functions, you might end up feeling less anxious if you drink it.\n9. Helps reduce toxins.\n10. Helps relieve symptoms of Achalasia\n\n*Achalasia is a condition during which your esophagus has trouble moving food down into your stomach. People with Achalasia (and with eosinophilic esophagitis) have trouble swallowing and also sometimes feel like foods get “stuck” (dysphagia) in their esophagus instead of moving to the stomach.\n*Taking a warm bath (not exceeding the body temperature) at night, helps your circulatory organs — your arteries and veins — to expand and carry blood more effectively throughout your body and relaxes your muscles.\n\nYour health counts...\n\nSonia Coutinho\n\n#Spreading Wellness\n\nMyGALF.com",

              "Seated Parvatasana / Mountain Pose :\n\nSeated Parvatasana / Mountain Pose is one of my favourite poses that I learned at the Pawan Dham Yoga Institute & the Yoga Institute during my 200 hours & 900 hours Teacher's Training Course. It's a gentle cleansing massage to all your internal organs, more like a daily detox. \n\nIt's been 4 years now that I have been practising this asana daily & I'm really grateful for the blessings & benefits of it that I have experienced in my life. It's my pleasure to share this Asana with all of you. \n\nParvatasana is a Cultural Asanas for lateral (upward) stretch of the spine. It is beneficial for mental, physical, emotional and spiritual growth & development. As the name suggests, it derives the benefits from the qualities of a mountain / parvata. Namely Stability, Fixity & Strength. Just like a mountain withstands storms, rain, hailstones, snow, sunshine & harsh weather's for decades, If grounded well, We too can withstand all hurdles in life. \n\nThis posture has 3 variations to provide all round stretch and twist to spine.\n\nA. Starting position to this Classical pose:\n\n\n\n1. Sit in Padmasana / Sukhasana, keeping the hands at their respective sides. Chest thrown well forward, keep the neck straight, the abdomen in normal contour, the chin drawn in and eyes focused on a single point straight ahead.\n\n\n\nSequence of steps:\n\n1. Inhaling, In 3 seconds, raise both the arms together, from their respective sides for an upward stretch.\n\n2. Join the palms to each other in this upward stretched position of arms. \n\n* Either interlace the fingers or keep the palms joined.\n\n* Keep the handsands close to the respective ears, abdomen maintained in normai contour and back straight.\n\n* Avoid bending the arms at the elbows and wrists, keeping.them stretched and\n\nstraight. Gaze fixed at a single point ahead.\n\n3. Maintain this fully stretched position (palms joined), for 6 seconds, retaining the\n\nbreath (final position).\n\n4. Returning to starting position: exhaling, in 3 seconds, first turn the palm position outwards and then keeping the arms straight, bring it down to the sides to complete 1 round. \n\nRecommended practice:  Practice 4 rounds without pause.\n\nVariation-1:\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting position same as A :\n\n1. Sit in starting position as mentioned above.\n\n2. Raise both the arms together from their respective sides to join the palms, keeping the hands straight, close to the ears.\n\nFingers can be interlaced or palms joined.\n\nSequence of steps:\n\n1. Inhaling, in 3 seconds, bend to the right, keeping the head between the arms. Let the spine arch sideways, with no movement below the waist.\n\n2. Immediately, exhaling, return to the centre position, in 3 seconds.\n\n3. Inhaling, in 3 seconds, repeat to the left to complete 1 round.\n\nVariation-2:\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting position. Same as A\n\nSequence of steps:\n\n1. Exhaling, twist your spine pivoting from lower end of spine towards the right side, maintaining fixity below the waist. This is an axial movement; hence maintain the upper torso as one unit while twisting. Complete this step, in 3 seconds, while exhaling. \n\n2. Immediately, inhaling, untwist the spine and return to centre position, in 3 seconds.\n\n3. Exhaling, now twist towards left, as explained in step 1, above, in 3 seconds.\n\n4. Inhaling, immediately untwist the spine and return to centre position, in 3 seconds.\n\nVariation-3:\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting position: same as A. \n\nSequence of steps: \n\n1. Inhaling, bend backwards keeping the head locked in between the arms. Let the spine arch backwards, with no movement below the waist. Complete this step, in 3 seconds, while inhaling.\n\n2. Immediately, exhaling, start bending forward (waist up) keeping the head locked in between the arms. Let the spine arch forward, with no movement below the waist, to bring the body parallel to the ground. Complete this step, in 3 seconds, while exhaling.\n\n3. Maintain this forward stretched position for 6 seconds, suspending the breath (final position).\n\n4. Inhaling, lift the head and arms and return to the centre position, in 3 seconds.\n\n\n\nReturning to starting position (for the variations): exhaling, in 3 seconds, first turn\n\nthe palm position outwards and then, keeping the arms straight, bring it down to the\n\nsides to complete 1 cycle of the above variations.\n\nRecommended practice (for all variations): Complete 1 cycle each of every variation, without pause. Practice total 2 cycles of the above variations.\n\nLimitations / Contraindications:\n\n1. People suffering from spinal injury and spinal abnormalities. \n\n2. Frozen shoulder and arthritis.\n\n3. Hypertension and serious cardiac complaints (especially Variation-3)\n\nBenefits of the Seated Parvatasana :\n\n1. Corrects minor postural defects of the spine and straightens the muscles of the back.\n\n2. Stretches all the abdominal and pelvic muscles and loosens the hips.\n\n3. Exercises the inactive waist zone, and helps reduce fatty and flabby abdomen.\n\n4. Unnatural curvature of the spine and minor displacements of the vertebrae are corrected.\n\n5. Internal organs in the abdominal region get proper massage-improved blood circulation; viscera rest normally on the pelvic floor.\n\n6. Prolapse (slipping down) of the uterus is improved by providing natural support to the viscera.\n\n7. Blood circulation in the vertebral region improves and the efficiency of the nerves coming out of the vertebra is improved.\n\n8. Improves body balance and posture.\n\n9. Enhances the functioning of the internal organs. \n\n10. When you practice this regularly, then your body becomes strong and the looseness of the body also gets removed.\n\n11. Parvatsana also removes tension in the shoulders and back\n\n12.This asana benefits both men and women alike, and full benefit can be obtained in the disease of premature ejaculation.\n\n13. This pose activates the heart chakra which helps one to feel sensations of deep love and peace.\n\nCaution:\n\nDon’t practice this pose’s full extension in case you have carpal tunnel syndrome since it places much stress on hands and the wrists. Rather, modify this posture by resting the forearms on the ground instead of holding your body up with the hands.\n\nWhen you do this asana, you should not be bowed down at your hands, keep your waist and hands fingers straight.\n\n\n\nDuring practice, if you find any pain or discomfort, please exit the pose and ask for the expert’s guidance and doctor’s advice.\n\nSources : Yoga Cyclopedia Vol. 1",

              "Science and Spirituality Agree: Daily Focus on Breathing is Important\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we leave the fluid of our mother's womb we breathe in the air without much thought. Our body is equipped to take in oxygen, keeping us alive, while we continue our day. So if our body does all of the thinking and work without our attention, why is it so important to create a daily practice focused around breathing? Seems like a waste of time, huh?\n\n\n\nMany of us have shallow breathing. This happens for various reasons but one is that we often live in survival mode. This state of being can create short and shallow breaths because we are not in a calm state of mind.\n\n\n\nFrom a manifestation perspective; focusing on our breath allows us to connect with the life force that exists outside of us and inside of us. This increases intuition, the stillness of cluttered thoughts and 'foggy' mind. This stillness increases our patience to allow divine timing for manifestations to unfold.\n\n\n\nThe ancient Sages and Yogis referred to controlled breathing as Pranayama. Pranayama is a Sanskrit word that means breath control. The word Prana means life force. The life force in each of us is breath. Without breathing we would cease to live on earth. With that said, it's probably worth some daily attention.\n\n\n\nThere are various forms of Pranayama. Some include holding one nostril down at a time, while others may be to increase the 'fire' in the body or to simply take in deep controlled breaths while mindfully observing the action of inhalation and exhalation. Yogis began these practices thousands of years ago, today, science is catching up...\n\n\n\nIan Robertson, Co-Director of the Global Brain Health Institute at Trinity and Principal Investigator of the study says: \"Yogis and Buddhist practitioners have long considered the breath an especially suitable object for meditation. It is believed that by observing the breath and regulating it in precise ways a practice known as pranayama changes in arousal, attention, and emotional control that can be of great benefit to the meditator are realised. Our research finds that there is evidence to support the view that there is a strong connection between breath-centred practices and steadiness of mind.\" Ian also went on to say that these breathing techniques also slow down the brain's ageing process. This means a reduced risk of dementia and strengthened brain networks.\n\n\n\nNirvana® is a perfect program for movers and shakers, pairing the art of breath control with the flow and movement to music. This system intrigued me so much that I decided to take the full course, it did not disappoint. I would like to share with you just a few key points that were my favorite about the Nirvana® curriculum.\n\n\n\nMusic with theta wave technology\n\n\n\n”Flow zone” brainwaves (alpha-theta border) gives you all the benefits of a flow state combined with other brainwaves creating a superconductive potential in all possible tasks and circumstances.\" (Nirvana Instructor Manual)\n\nBreathing optimization\n\nThe science behind Nirvana® has shown to increase natural levels of dopamine, endorphins, anandamide, and oxytocin serotonin.\n\nBreakdown of breaths per minute\n\nMore than 12 breaths per minute is a sign of stress, anxiety and depression.\n\nIf you are in the 7 - 9 breaths per minute range, that is good.\n\nAn average of 4 breaths per minute is excellent. (Yeah, I was surprised too.)\n\n\n\nAlthough it would take much more than one article to share with you all of the research and techniques to mindful breathing, I hope this has sparked enough curiosity to begin a daily practice and possibly learn more.",

              "This article is based on guidelines provided by World Health Organisation, John Hopkins Medicine Network, and The Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) Sports Medicine Institute.\n\nAs far as virulence and unpredictability of viral infections go, COVID-19 is right up there. Not just with symptoms and response, but in recovery and rehabilitation too, wide variance is being observed. The disease affects everyone differently and the impact of long-term effects are still being discovered. \n\nWhile exercise and movement are therapeutic for illness in general and strongly encouraged, crafting general recommendations/advice for resuming activity and exercise post-exposure to COVID-19 is not easy because of this variance. We now know that the virus can impact multiple organs and systems (heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, musculoskeletal, etc.) and some effects may be silent and/or protracted. Many people have reported breathlessness and high and prolonged fatigue, making resuming activity and exercise difficult. Even otherwise fit and healthy people have not been immune to these challenges.\n\nIn this article, I'm giving you the option of watching my video on the same. The aim is to spread the message of how to properly recover and resume activity post COVID-19 Illness.\n\nSo for those readjusting to normal life post-COVID-19, what are the guidelines, especially with respect to exercise?\n\nA perusal of recommendations issued by different medical/health publications throws up some key pointers to facilitate the process in those recovering from COVID-19, irrespective of the severity of their symptoms, including those who were asymptomatic.\n\nEXERCISE GUIDELINES*\nJohn Hopkins Medicine Network recommends progressive exercising as part of their rehabilitation protocol. Briefly, the classification is as follows:\n\nDeep Breathing Exercises: lying, sitting, and standing.\nVestibular Activation Exercises (controls balance and sensory input): These involve moving the eyes and head up and down, side to side; body rolls on the bed; rocking body movements (seated on a chair, standing and rocking on hands and knees)\nCross Body Movements: Touching right knee/thigh with the left hand, lifting the leg, etc.)\nStrength Building Exercises: Yawn to smile exercise; Bicep Curls; Shoulder elevation and press exercises; Standing heel raises with overhead arm raises; Wall push-ups; Mini Squats, etc.)\nEndurance Building Exercises: Progressive cardio 5 min/10 min/30-45 min\nAll exercises should ideally be performed with deep breathing.\n\nIn conjunction with the above, it is worth considering guidelines published by The Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) Sports Medicine Institute in New York City, for returning to exercise after living with mild to moderate COVID-19. These touch upon six key areas, relating to symptoms. Briefly stated, the recommendations include:\n\nBlood (Hematologic) Symptoms: Less sedentary behaviour will reduce the risk of blood clots. Start with gentle, low-intensity exercises.\nRespiratory Symptoms (pneumonia, breathlessness): It’s recommended to wait for at least a week after symptoms subside. There should be a gradual return to activity levels with careful monitoring of breathing effort and response.\nCardiac/Heart Symptoms: Recommended resting for 2-3 weeks after symptoms subside. Those with suspected Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscles), may have to wait for 3-6 months before resuming any exercise regimen. This may need additional testing and requires careful monitoring. \nGastrointestinal Symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite): Monitor fluid and calorie intake while slowly easing into exercise.\nMusculoskeletal Symptoms (aches and pains): Go gradual with exercise intensity.\nNo Symptoms: Gradual easing, nevertheless. If no known symptoms for a full week, resume activity at 50% of normal capacity. Pay attention to how your body feels.\n*Please see precautions below. \n\nPRECAUTIONS:\nBear these important points in mind before initiating, and during exercise:\n\nConsult your physician whether it’s safe to exercise or not.\nTread cautiously and start slow.\nDo NOT exercise if:\n\nIf you have a fever or feeling unwell\nYou have difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, even at rest\nYou have chest pains, irregular heartbeat, or palpitations\nYou have swellings in your legs or extremities\nSTOP exercising immediately if you develop any of these symptoms:\n\nShortness of breath/difficulty breathing\nChest pain/palpitations\nDizziness\nHeadache\nNausea\nExcessive fatigue / muscular pain\nCool, clammy skin\nSwelling in extremities\nPassing out\nExperience vision blurring or tunnel vision\nThe key to recovery from an illness is to initiate movement and exercise as safely and timely as possible, depending upon your symptoms and body’s response.\n\nListen to your body, do only what you can handle, and seek your doctor’s advice without hesitation when in doubt.\nABOUT VANI PAHWA\nVani B.

              "World Mental Health Day is an international day for global mental health education, awareness and advocacy against social stigma. Know it well that there is “no one size fits all”. Understanding your current health and consulting a specialist is of paramount importance. One also needs to exercise discretion on social media posts including the one that you are reading now. ",

              "As per a survey published by ASSOCHAM is 2015, nearly 42.5% of private sector employees suffered from stress induced depression and indicative survey by a professional networking platform in 2021 indicates number to be nearly 55% conservatively. Whether we like it or not, pandemic has brought in a change of civilisation in socio-economic fabric. The after effects of pandemic on mental and emotional health are still being researched. As an established “Holistic Wellness Ecosystem for Corporates” we are sharing 7 points guide that may help to keep emotional and mental health in check. It may or may not resonate with all: \n\n\n\nInformation Binge\nThere is just too much of information everywhere and it’s an emotional and mental assault of sorts. What information we spend time on, really decides our behaviour and outlook. Hence, watch out what you see and hear. If you aren’t ready for information at given moment then  IT’S ALRIGHT TO SWITCH OFF, \n\n\n\nWorld Is Not Perfect\nYearning for perfection every time, is one of the major cause of stress. Understand that situation and outcomes can evolve to become better over time. We do advocate the pursuit for excellence and making things better over a period of time. However not being kind to self and others is literally a crime. World is not perfect and there is beauty in imperfection too. SO  LEARN TO LET GO\n\n\n\nKnow Your Triggers \nMood swings are a very commonly reported issue now a days and sudden outbursts can be witnessed in practically every office and household. Knowing what’s the real trigger is important; it can range from mere sleep deprivation to financial situation, emotional event, physical problem or even lack of appropriate nutrition. TAKE A PAUSE AND ASK WHAT’S TROUBLING ME !\n\n\n\nToo Much Too Soon\nWhether we are new initiator, moderate practitioner or fitness freak demigods of sorts. It’s important to know your readiness level. Constant comparison with others or the utopian versions of self can push us towards too much too soon. This may cause severe mental stress and burnouts that our body may find too difficult to recuperate from. Rule of thumb is to train at 60-80% of your current readiness levels and TAKE BABY STEPS FURTHER. \n\n\nHydration and Nutrition\nWhat we consume makes us; this is not only true for physical health but for our mental health too. Hydrating ourselves well helps maintain blood pressure and monitors stress & anxiety levels. There are food types that can be more calming than others. They help improve the quality of sleep, which is therapeutic for mental health. What we CHOOSE TO PUT IN OUR PLATE will always help manage our mindset, mood and stress levels.\n\n\n\nBreathing And Heart Rate Monitoring \nIf you would have noticed whenever there is a change in our mood form for e.g. happiness, sadness, anger, anxiety etc, the first trigger of it is; the change in our breathing pattern and our blood pressure. Conversely if there is poor breathing pattern and blood pressure; it does impact our mental balance, behaviour and reactions. So keeping an eye on how well we breathe, oxygenate and monitor our blood pressure is the key. Regular walking and breathing workouts are established practices that can help. So take a DEEP BREATH AND KEEP MOVING.\n\n\n\nFind A Friend\nIs there a lot piling inside of you in terms of thoughts and emotions? Are you covering up with a smile or being a social animal. Find someone to whom you can express and explain. In acute cases though; usually, depression is associated with sadness, lethargy, and despair — someone who can’t make it out of bed. Though someone experiencing depression can undoubtedly feel these things, how depression presents itself can vary from person to person. “Smiling depression” is a term for someone living with depression on the inside while appearing perfectly happy or content on the outside. We always recommend to consult a mental health specialist or counsellor who are professionally trained. Its OKAY TO BE NOT OKAY. \n\nHelp us advocate it !!",
